# Heart-Failure-Disease-Prediction-R-Data-Analysis

# Introduction
Background
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, accounting for 31% of all fatalities worldwide. Heart attacks and strokes account for four out of every five CVD fatalities, and one-third of these deaths occur in adults under the age of 70. Heart failure is a major complication of CVDs, and this dataset contains 11 indicators that can be used to predict heart disease.

# Goal of my Study
The project's goal is to determine what types of chest pains are severe and tend to support heart disease, as well as to anticipate general causes of heart disease.

# Data
Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
This dataset was developed by integrating several datasets that were previously accessible individually but had not been merged. This dataset combines 5 heart datasets with 11 shared characteristics, making it the biggest heart disease dataset available for research purposes to date.
The five datasets utilized for curation are as follows: 
● Cleveland has had 303 observations.
● 294 observations in Hungary
● 123 observations from Switzerland
● 200 observations were made at Long Beach, Virginia. 
● 270 observations in the Stalog (Heart) Data Set
1190 observations in total
272 observations were duplicated.
The total number of observations in the final dataset is 918. For this dataset, no possible issues were identified.
